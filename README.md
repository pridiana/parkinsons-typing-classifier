Here is Parkinsons typing classifier project that was completed in November 2024

Parkinson's disease(PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that affects movement. Over time, its symptoms tend to worsen. Common symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, speech difficulties, loss of balance, and challenges with initiating movement. PD is usually diagnosed by a clinician who evaluates symptoms, medical history, and diagnostic tests. However, using a classifier based on keyboard typing data offers a way to detect PD early without requiring a clinician. This approach has the potential to transform the diagnostic process. An ideal strategy would involve using the classifier as an initial screening tool for early detection, followed by consultation with a doctor for an accurate diagnosis. A PD specialist can not only confirm the diagnosis but also recommend the most effective treatment plan tailored to the individual.
