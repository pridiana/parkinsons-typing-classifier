Here is Parkinsons typing classifier project that was completed in November 2024

Parkinson's disease(PD) is a progressive neurodegenerative condition that affects movement. Over time, its symptoms tend to worsen. Common symptoms include tremors, muscle stiffness, speech difficulties, loss of balance, and challenges with initiating movement. PD is usually diagnosed by a clinician who evaluates symptoms, medical history, and diagnostic tests. However, using a classifier based on keyboard typing data offers a way to detect PD early without requiring a clinician. This approach has the potential to transform the diagnostic process. An ideal strategy would involve using the classifier as an initial screening tool for early detection, followed by consultation with a doctor for an accurate diagnosis. A PD specialist can not only confirm the diagnosis but also recommend the most effective treatment plan tailored to the individual.

- exploring-classifiers.ipynb: is a Jupyter Notebook that contains the code to the exploration of different classifiers and techniques 
- results.ipynb: is a Jupyter Notebook that contains code on the final result of the AdaBoost classifer with feature selection and bayesian hyperparameter tuning

The two articles that helped me in choosing what information to extract and put it into a 85x67 dataset are: 
- neuroQWERTY article: "Computer keyboard interaction as an indicator of early Parkinson’s disease"[1]
- Tappy article: "High-accuracy detection of early Parkinson's Disease using multiple characteristics of finger movement while typing" [2]

Each article has a corresponding dataset. I used the dataset for the neuroQWERTY article only. But here is the link to both:
- neuroQWERTY dataset: https://physionet.org/content/nqmitcsxpd/1.0.0/
- Tappy dataset: https://physionet.org/content/tappy/1.0.0/
